# Abstractive-Query-Focused-Multi-Document-Summarizer
The system uses a variety of tools and methods to automate the summary process and increase users' access to information, including web scraping, natural language processing, and transformer models. A user's inquiry, the amount of words to be condensed, and the number of documents to be cited can all be entered into the system. The most pertinent webpages are then retrieved via a Google search engine API integration, and tag web scraping is carried out using the beautiful soup (bs4) and selenium frameworks.The pre-processed data is tokenized using Auto tokenizer, stop words are removed from the scraped data, and matplotlib and seaborn are used to visualise frequency matrices and word clouds. The pipeline summarizer in the system uses a transformer model called "mt5-small Pretrained." By ranking the terms according to their frequency, the transformer model creates a summary of the text that is logical, succinct, and pertinent to the user's question. The result of the system is a well-organized summary that gathers the crucial details from several sources.
